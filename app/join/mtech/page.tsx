                        The M.Tech. program in <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong> at 
                        <strong> IIT Indore</strong> is a two-year postgraduate program designed to train 
                        students in advanced computing technologies, research methodologies, and 
                        problem-solving skills needed for industry and academia.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Admission to the program is done primarily through the 
                        <strong> GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering)</strong>, followed by 
                        institute-level procedures. Students with strong academic backgrounds and a 
                        passion for research are especially encouraged to apply.
